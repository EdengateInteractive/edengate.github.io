                <p>We are proud to announce Project Crucible - a survival horror game with light immersive-sim and rogue-like elements set in the trenches of a world war.
                    We have been working on this game for almost a month and we would like to share our progress with you.</p>
                <p>The story takes place during a final stand for a Soviet-inspired faction and city. The enemy is advancing on the far reaches of the trench and the player faction needs to make a final stand before everything is lost.
                    After a brutal offense, the player finds himself alone in the trench, gasping for air. With none of their commrades in sight, the player character decides that the best course of action is to find their general who is presumed to have fled deep into the bunker.
                    However, getting there won't be easy cause the player is not fully alone in the trench. Monstrosities garbed in soldier attire march endlessly towards the player and they seem to be beyond the point of reasoning with.
                    Throughout the game the player will slowly start to piece together what happened to these fallen soliders.</p>
                <p>The game was insired by the classics of the survival horror genre like Resident Evil and Silent Hill while also taking notes on recent titles such as Amnesia: The Bunker.
                    We tried to emulate the PSX style while trying something new and that's where we introduced ourpost processing effect which offers a dither-like effect found in games from the PS1 era.
                    The post-processing lifts the looks of the game and textures to new heights. The textures were enhanced by PixelIt.
                    It's a website used for pixelizing images and it really allowed us to achieve that nostalgic pixelated look.</p>
                <p>Project Crucible is going to be a blend of the survival-horror, rogue-like, and immersive-sim genre. In regards to the latter, we are yet to implement these systems and see how they interact with other systems in the world.
                    While we are still lacking immersive-sim elements, we already have some elements of the rogue-like genre and that is the random ammo spawner system. We create a game object that will choose from a list of items to spawn in the area we choose.</p>
                <div class="PCD1textimage-container-left-layout">
                    <p>The system, as of now, cycles between spawning pistol or shotgun ammo and on top of that it will spawn varying amounts so that the player never feels like they're fully ready out in the trench.
                        We hope to further iterate on this system and make every run through the trench different.
                        There are currenntly two weapons in the game - the pistol and the trenchgun. The pistol was inspired by the Tokarev TT3, a pistol used by the Soviets. The trenchgun is a world war staple when it comes to shotguns and we felt like we needed to include it regardless.
                        The guns were implemented using the NeoFPS Toolkit package from the Unity Asset Store. It is a great system that allows us to fully customize firearms through a modular wizard that makes it very convenient to set up.</p>

                <p>The goal of the trench, which is designated as the first half of the game, is to navigate a maze-like level and get to the bunker. To ramp up the challenge we plan to introduce obstacles that the  player needs to clear with dynamite in order to progress.
                    To further randomzie this experience we plan on creating different spawn points of these obstacles as well as dynamite - forcing the player to be thorough in their search for resources in order to tay alive and reach the bunker.
                    The aforementioned bunker will serve as second half of the game and will feature a different kind of gameplay loop compared to the trench. More details on this later.</p>
                <p>We have uploaded our first devlog on our YouTube channel going over of the contents of the game in detail while also giving you an in-depth look behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>We hope you've enjoyed this log and we will see you in the next one.</p>
